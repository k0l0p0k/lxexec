lxexec

INTRO
-----

Small replacement for the included 'Run'-dialog by lxpanel.

In first I create it to gain more experience in programming with C and the GTK+
toolkit.

I am pleased for comments.


USAGE
-----

Bind this executeable in your openbox shortcut file at 'Alt-F2'.

Thats all.


Have Fun.
